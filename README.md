### Banmiok Game Project

BANMIOK is a game which was my first project. With almost 1000 questions, I desingned a platform that intellectual game enthusiasts can read the questions and answer them for online competition. Each user had unique profile with username and password for individual competition. The game had features of:

1. Online Individual Competitions
2. Questions are not repeated
3. Live support for answer malfunctions
4. Platform for question insertion
5. Time constraints to answer questions

More Challenging, More fun!
